# 8051_Coding_dummy

This small python App will simulate running assembly code on the 8051 micro controller.</br>
Simulating some of the 8051 micro controller to run simple assembly code and see the memory values

This code isn't meant to be correct or complete; just a simple tool to practice beginner level assembly coding with :)
### Requirements and how to use
To use this App all you need is python 3 and the modules listed in `requirements.txt` which is only the bitarray module</br>

then you can head into src folder and run `python Application.py code.s` in which `code.s` is the assembly code you wish to run.</br>

### Examples
